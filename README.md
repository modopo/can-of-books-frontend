# Can of Books Frontend

**Author**: Jonathan Tsai, Daniel Yoon

**Version**: 1.5.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
People want to keep track of their books and which ones are checked-out of the system, so we create a small book inventory management system.

## Getting Started
* Ensure that you have node.js and npm installed.
* Use npm install to install dependencies.
* Have a .env file with variable REACT_APP_SERVER that has a link to a Can-of-Books server (or your local server).
* Run npm start to start React app.

## Architecture
This application uses React for the UI and makes API calls through axios.

    * Jon: backend

* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    * We're implementing our weakness in the lab, and we'll consult each other if struggling.

* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    * Daniel: Handling errors
    * Jon: Undersanding css at a deep fundamental level.

* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    * Standup, delegate, check-ins at milestones. Daily.

**Conflict Resolution**

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    * Call it out, and discuss.

* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
