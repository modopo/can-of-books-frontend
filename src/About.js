        <p>I'm Jonathan, and I'm a software developer with a little more emphasis on backend. I have a background in marketing and advertising with display ads, first at Meredith and at Amazon. After a decade of advertising, I found myself wanting to automate a lot of my tasks. After seeing overhead work and timeline it required to even start with other engineering teams, I just took on the task to do it myself. That was where I found the apsiration to make a career transition to coding.

        <p>I'm Daniel Yoon! Iâ€™m currently a Software Developer specializing in web applications. I build useful and visually appealing tools using modern Javascript libraries such as React. Previously, I used to work in roles involving logistics and retail. Working with clients and teams across different businesses has helped me gain a sense of the kind of needs and expectations that users have for different industries and platforms. I'm excited to work on projects that make a strong impact on the world. I'm also a collector of various things, with my most recent interest being headphones!</p>
